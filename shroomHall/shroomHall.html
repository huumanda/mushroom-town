        Hi! Welcome to this website designed by me, Amanda.
        <br> <br>
        <br> <br>
      <p>
        This space is designed for GRPH-2010-006 Graphic Design 2, Assignment II: WWW. In which the assignment's description is 
        <br> <br>
         " “Websites are places. They provide services and social environments. Like architecture, they distribute access
        and atmospheric context to these resources”
        <br> <br>
        —www--arc.com
        <br> <br>
        <br> <br>
        The World Wide Web began as a means of augmenting text by turning it into a distributed network of links. It quickly 
        evolved into a network of spaces—public, private, natural, and architectural. Today, with the need to (temporarily) 
        isolate and stay away from the physical spaces we normally occupy, our virtual spaces are ever more important. Let’s 
        use this frame to become better acquainted with the materiality of the web. 
        <br> <br>
        In this module you will learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS (with some Javascript thrown in) through weekly workshops 
        and assignments."
