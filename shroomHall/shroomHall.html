        My name's Amanda and the purpose of this space is designed for GRPH-2010-006 Graphic Design 2, Assignment II: WWW.

        ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
        <br> <br>
         “Websites are places. They provide services and social environments. Like architecture, they distribute access
        and atmospheric context to these resources”
        <br> <br>
        —www--arc.com
        <br> <br>
        The World Wide Web began as a means of augmenting text by turning it into a distributed network of links. It quickly 
        evolved into a network of spaces—public, private, natural, and architectural. Today, with the need to (temporarily) 
        isolate and stay away from the physical spaces we normally occupy, our virtual spaces are ever more important. Let’s 
        use this frame to become better acquainted with the materiality of the web. 
        <br> <br>
        In this module you will learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS (with some Javascript thrown in) through weekly workshops 
        and assignments."

        The theme of this space is all about mushrooms 
        <br><br>
        The process of this site starts with choosing between 3 ideas, a fish market, mushroom town or a coffee shop
        <li>ended up choosing mushroom town</li>
      </p>
        <p> 
        After that, I gathered some research on the different types of mushroom and drew the buildings on Adobe photoshop. The paths, arrows
        and entrance were done using CSS. You can find other resources and tools I've used at the library, just go north once you exit this path.
        <br> <br>
        You can use the list above to teleport to the other areas from here too.
