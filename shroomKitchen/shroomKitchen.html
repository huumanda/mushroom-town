                    “Golden Chanterelles are one of the most popular and prolific wild mushrooms, growing all across 
                    Europe (cibarius) and North America (fomosus, elenensis, phasmatis, appalachiensis, lateritius 
                    and more). Amazingly there are over 40 different varieties to be found across North America.
                    While it can be difficult to distinguish between types, in general chanterelles are very easy to 
                    identify and super easy to cook, better yet they can act as a gateway to foraging other mushrooms.
                    Their mild, nutty, almost apricot-like flavour makes them really versatile in the kitchen.

                     Many folks
                     say they are best prepared simply: sautéed in butter or used in cream sauces, and served with chicken or 
                     egg dishes. Use in dishes where they do not have to compete with strong flavours.”

                    "The mushrooms you most commonly see in the supermarket are cultivated white mushrooms. Their caps 
                    range in diameter from 1/2 to 3 inches, but it is only the smallest specimens that are labelled “button mushrooms.”

                    White mushrooms have a mild, earthy flavor. Though their flavor is pleasantly subtle—almost bland—when raw,
                    it deepens nicely as they are cooked. These mushrooms are available year-round but are at their peak in fall and winter."

               " Morels are a distinct looking mushroom with a cone-shaped cap and sponge-like texture.
                 They typically grow between two and four inches tall. The caps stand erect and range in color 
                 from pale cream to almost black with a well-defined pitted texture. Morels are hollow and have 
                 a white- to pale cream-colored stem. They need to be cleaned, but otherwise, require very little
                preparation before cooking and are best when simply grilled or sautéed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Morels have the strange ability to attract people who typically don't enjoy mushrooms. They have an earthy 
                flavor that's nutty and woodsy. The darker the color of the morel, the smokier, nuttier, and earthier the flavor."
