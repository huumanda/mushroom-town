                "One of the best mushrooms for color is Phaeolus schweinitzii, "the dyer’s polypore". 
                    The best time to pick and dry this mushroom is when the outer growing edge is bright yellow,
                     with yellow-green pores underneath. When cooked with alum-mordanted wool and a 1:1 ratio,
                      the color will be a bright yellow or gold. Iron-mordanted wool will dye a consistent dark 
                      moss green with yellow tones and copper-mordanted wool will dye a rich chocolate brown. 
                      As the mushroom turns all brown with age, the color of the wool will be muddy looking or subdued.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Phaeolus schweinitzii is a great mushroom for beginning dyers because it can be overcooked, undercooked, 
                    too little an amount or old pieces used, or rinsed out too soon, and still dye amazing colors. The old
                     fruiting bodies, which are weak for dyeing, do not break down quickly in the woods so they may be found
                      in fall or late spring."

                    "Mycoremediation is one of the biotechniques that recruits fungi to remove toxic pollutants from environment 
                    in an efficient and economical manner. Mushrooms, macro-fungi, are among the nature’s most important mycoremediators. 
                    Pleurotus species (also called oyster mushrooms) are considered to be the most popular and widely cultivated varieties
                    worldwide and this might be attributed to their low production cost and higher yields. Apart from their nutritive and
                    therapeutic properties, Pleurotus species have high biosorption potential due to their extensive biomass, i.e.
                    mycelial production. The genus has been reported to accumulate high levels of heavy metals. The current state-of-the
                    art review mainly summarises previous investigations carried out by researchers on different roles and mechanisms
                     played by Pleurotus species on heavy metals mycoremediation."

                "The Goomba was the last enemy created during the development process of Super Mario Bros.
                 despite being the first encountered. During development, the only basic enemy was the Koopa Troopa.
                However, play testers had stated that the Koopa Troopa was too tricky of an enemy to have as the first one.
                Using this, the developers decided to create an enemy that could be defeated with a single stomp. The Goomba
                itself was created with the appearance of a shiitake mushroom. Since the enemy was created toward the end
                of the development cycle, though, hardly any bytes remained on the cartridge. Therefore, to give the enemy
                moving animations, the developers reused and flipped the image, making it appear to be walking."

                "Galerina autumnalis can be identified by its brown cap, with a relatively small fragile annulus (ring) 
                on the stipe (stem). The lower part of the stipe is usually darker brown, sometimes with apparent floccules,
                or little tufts of hyphae. Above the annulus (the remnant of the partial veil), the stipe is usually lighter
                tan in color and lacks ornamentation. The gills are about the same color as the top of the stipe and darken 
                with age. The mushrooms are usually not very big, with the caps only about an inch or two (2-5 cm) in diameter
                and the stipes are usually less than 2 inches (5 cm). The spore print is a rusty brown.            
                <br>
                <br>
                The toxin contained in Galerina is the same toxin, a-amanitin, contained in the destroying angels, 
                Amanita virosa, A. verna, A. bisporigera, and A. ocreata. 
                It induces exactly the same symptoms: The toxin in Galerina (and in the death angels) is a relatively small protein of eight amino acids, 
                a cyclopeptide called a-amanitin."

               "Gyromitra esculenta, commonly called the False Morel or the Turban Fungus, is deadly poisonous. 
               Unfortunately it is sometimes mistakenly collected by people looking for Morels Morchella esculenta. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Cooking has been shown to reduce the toxicity, but even well-cooked False Morels have caused poisoning,
                 so cooking is not a guarantee of safety, as there is evidence that repeated meals of these fungi cause a 
                 build-up of toxins in the body. Early symptoms of gyrotoxin poisoning include stomach pains, sweating and
                  vomiting leading to dizziness and in some cases coma. Gyrotoxin affects the central nervous system and
                   goes on to damage the victim's liver and possibly also the kidneys."
