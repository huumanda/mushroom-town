                            "Destroying Angels contain a complex group of poisonous substances called amatoxins. Contained not
                            only in certain amanitas but also in some fungi from the genera Galerina, Lepiota and Conocybe, amatoxins
                            initially cause gastrointestinal disorders with symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and stomach pains occurring within
                            five to twelve hours. Cruelly, the symptoms usually fade away for several hours or even a day or two, tricking the
                            victim into thinking that they are recovering. When in due course the symptoms return with a vengeance, it may well
                            be too late: kidney and liver damage is already underway. Without treatment, coma and eventual death are almost 
                            inevitable."

                            "Originally discovered in China in 1895, the reddish-orange poison fire coral (Podostroma cornu-damae) 
                            is predominantly encountered in Asia, including Korea, Japan, and the Java Islands. When even a tiny amount is
                             touched or consumed, it can cause your skin to peel off, your hair to fall out, your brain to shrink, and a whole

                           Commonly found on tree roots and in the soil, the mushroom produces at least eight toxic compounds that
                            can be absorbed straight through the skin. Without a known cure or treatment, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5065333/"

                            "Amanita phalloides is the most dangerous mushroom, considered responsible for some 90% of mushroom fatalities around the world. 
                            It has spread rapidly since its introduction into the western coastal areas of North America. They often have 
                            a rather tall stature. They are found in late summer and fall or rarely in late spring. They make white spore
                             prints.

                            Colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea: symptoms subside after about one day; then about
                             72 hours post ingestion, gastrointestinal symptoms recur along with signs of impending liver failure.
                               In fatal cases death occurs 7 to 10 days after the first onset of symptoms."

                        "Galerina autumnalis can be identified by its brown cap, with a relatively small fragile annulus (ring) 
                        on the stipe (stem). The lower part of the stipe is usually darker brown, sometimes with apparent floccules,
                        or little tufts of hyphae. Above the annulus (the remnant of the partial veil), the stipe is usually lighter
                        tan in color and lacks ornamentation. The gills are about the same color as the top of the stipe and darken 
                        with age. The mushrooms are usually not very big, with the caps only about an inch or two (2-5 cm) in diameter
                        and the stipes are usually less than 2 inches (5 cm). The spore print is a rusty brown.

                        <br>
                        The toxin contained in Galerina is the same toxin, a-amanitin, contained in the destroying angels, 
                        Amanita virosa, A. verna, A. bisporigera, and A. ocreata. 
                        It induces exactly the same symptoms: The toxin in Galerina (and in the death angels) is a relatively small protein of eight amino acids, 
                        a cyclopeptide called a-amanitin."

                       "Gyromitra esculenta, commonly called the False Morel or the Turban Fungus, is deadly poisonous. 
                       Unfortunately it is sometimes mistakenly collected by people looking for Morels Morchella esculenta.

                        <br>
                        Cooking has been shown to reduce the toxicity, but even well-cooked False Morels have caused poisoning,
                         so cooking is not a guarantee of safety, as there is evidence that repeated meals of these fungi cause a 
                         build-up of toxins in the body. Early symptoms of gyrotoxin poisoning include stomach pains, sweating and
                          vomiting leading to dizziness and in some cases coma. Gyrotoxin affects the central nervous system and
                           goes on to damage the victim's liver and possibly also the kidneys."
