                            "Destroying Angels contain a complex group of poisonous substances called amatoxins. Contained not
                            only in certain amanitas but also in some fungi from the genera Galerina, Lepiota and Conocybe, amatoxins
                            initially cause gastrointestinal disorders with symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and stomach pains occurring within
                            five to twelve hours. Cruelly, the symptoms usually fade away for several hours or even a day or two, tricking the
                            victim into thinking that they are recovering. When in due course the symptoms return with a vengeance, it may well
                            be too late: kidney and liver damage is already underway. Without treatment, coma and eventual death are almost 
                            inevitable."

                            "Originally discovered in China in 1895, the reddish-orange poison fire coral (Podostroma cornu-damae) 
                            is predominantly encountered in Asia, including Korea, Japan, and the Java Islands. When even a tiny amount is
                             touched or consumed, it can cause your skin to peel off, your hair to fall out, your brain to shrink, and a whole

                           Commonly found on tree roots and in the soil, the mushroom produces at least eight toxic compounds that
                            can be absorbed straight through the skin. Without a known cure or treatment, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5065333/"

                            "Amanita phalloides is the most dangerous mushroom, considered responsible for some 90% of mushroom fatalities around the world. 
                            It has spread rapidly since its introduction into the western coastal areas of North America. They often have 
                            a rather tall stature. They are found in late summer and fall or rarely in late spring. They make white spore
                             prints.

                            Colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea: symptoms subside after about one day; then about
                             72 hours post ingestion, gastrointestinal symptoms recur along with signs of impending liver failure.
                               In fatal cases death occurs 7 to 10 days after the first onset of symptoms."

                        Not to be confused with fancy bite-sized chocolates of the same name, savoury truffles are subterranean fungi 
                        grown in calcareous soils near the roots of broadleaved trees such as oak or hazelnut. They’re mostly produced
                        in concentrated areas around the world, including France, Italy, New Zealand, China, North Africa, the Middle East,
                        and the Pacific Northwest.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Black truffles give off a pungent aroma and usually taste better when cooked. The flavour is often
                        described as being nutty, earthy, woody, mushroomy, and even a little chocolatey.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        White truffles are somewhat more subtle by comparison, though still completely discernible when 
                        added to any dish. They give off a musky aroma and deliver a taste that’s typically described as being lightly garlicky.

                       "Enoki mushrooms or Enokitake (literally “Enoki mushroom” in Japanese) is a type of cultivated mushroom
                        consisting of a cluster of long, thin white stalks with white caps. They are also known as jingu (Chinese), 
                        paengi beoseot (Korean), and nấm kim châm (Vietnamese). Enoki mushrooms are a cultivar of Flammulina velutipes,
                        better known as wild Enoki mushrooms, which have shorter stems, are peachy-brown in color, and have large caps. 
                        Enoki grow naturally from the stumps of the Chinese Hackberry tree, but may also grow on ash, persimmon, or mulberry 
                        trees. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Enoki mushrooms have a firm texture and mild, fruity flavor. When selecting Enoki mushrooms, inspect the cluster
                        thoroughly. You want a cluster of Enoki that is firm and white — avoid anything that appears slimy or discolored."
