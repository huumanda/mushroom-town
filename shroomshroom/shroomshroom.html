           <h1>CHAPTER LXIII :  MUSHROOMS </h1>
                <p> 
                While they were talking about insects and flowers, time had slipped by until the Sunday 
                arrived when Uncle Paul was to tell about mushrooms. The gathering was larger than the 
                first time. The story of poisonous plants had been repeated in the village. Some people 
                in a rut, content with their stupid ignorance, had said: “What is the use of it?” “The use!”
                 replied the others; “it teaches one to beware of poisonous plants, so as not to die miserably 
                 like poor Joseph.” But those in the rut had tossed their heads with a satisfied air. Nothing 
                 is so sufficient unto itself as folly. So only willing listeners came to Uncle Paul.
                <br> <br>
                “Of all poisonous plants, my friends,” he began, “mushrooms are the most formidable; and yet 
                some furnish a delightful food capable of tempting the soberest.”
                <br> <br>

                “For my part,” observed Simon, “I acknowledge, nothing is equal to a dish of mushrooms.”
                <br> <br>

                “Nobody will accuse you of gluttony, for, as I have just said, mushrooms can tempt the soberest
                . I do not wish to discourage their use. I know too well what a resource they are in the country;
                 I simply propose to put you on your guard against the poisonous kinds.”
                 <br> <br>

                “You are going to teach us to distinguish the good from the bad?” asked Mathieu.
                <br> <br>

                “No; that is impossible for us.”
                <br> <br>

                “How impossible? Everybody knows that you can eat without fear mushrooms that grow at the foot of such and such a tree.”
                <br> <br>

                “Before answering that remark, I will address myself to you all and ask: Have you confidence in my word? Do you think that passing one’s life in studying such things is more instructive than the hear-say of those who do not concern themselves with these matters?”
                <br> <br>

                “You may speak, Maître Paul: we all have full confidence in your learning,” Simon made answer for the company.
                <br> <br>

                “Well, then, I repeat it in all conviction: it is impossible for us who are not specialists
                 to distinguish an edible mushroom from a poisonous one, for none has a mark to say: This is 
                 eatable and this is not. Neither the nature of the ground, nor the trees at the foot of which
                  they grow, nor their form, color, taste, smell, can teach us anything or enable us to distinguish 
                  at sight the harmless from the poisonous. I admit that a person who had passed long years studying
                   mushrooms with the minute attention of a scientist would succeed in distinguishing pretty well the 
                   poisonous from the harmless, just as one acquires a knowledge of any other plant; but can we undertake
                    such studies? Have we the time? We scarcely know a dozen weeds, and yet we would presume to pass judgment
                     on the properties of mushrooms, so many in kind and resembling one another so closely?
                </p>

                </div>
                <p> 
                    “I hasten to add that, in every locality, actual use has long since taught the people some
                     kinds that they can eat without danger. It is a good thing to conform to this usage, which 
                     makes us profit by other people’s experience—on condition, be it understood, that we acquaint 
                     ourselves with the kinds used. But that is not enough to keep us safe from all peril. It is so 
                     easy to make a mistake! And then, go to another place and you will come across other mushrooms
                     which, while apparently of the same family as those you have known as eatable, will be dangerous. 
                     My rule of conduct is, you see, absolute: you must beware of all mushrooms; excess of prudence 
                     is necessary here.”
                     <br> <br>

                    “I admit with you,” said Simon, “that it is impossible for us to distinguish at sight the eatable
                     from the poisonous kinds; but there are ways of deciding the question.”
                     <br> <br>

                    “Tell us how.”
                    <br> <br>

                    “In the autumn we cut mushrooms in slices and dry them in the sun. They are excellent food
                     for winter. The poisonous mushrooms rot without drying. The good ones keep.”
                     <br> <br>

                    “Wrong. All mushrooms, good or bad indifferently, keep or spoil according to their more or 
                    less advanced state and according to the weather at the time of preparation. This characteristic 
                    is of no value whatever.”
                    <br> <br>

                    “Worms attack good mushrooms,” Antoine here interposed; “they do not attack bad ones, because they poison them.”
                    <br> <br>

                    “That characteristic is no better than the other one. Worms attack all old mushrooms, bad as well
                     as good; for what would be death to us is harmless to them. Their stomach is made so that they can
                      eat poison with impunity. Certain insects eat aconite, digitalis, belladonna; they feast on what would kill us.”
                      <br> <br>

                    “They say,” remarked Jean, “that a piece of silver put in the pot when the mushrooms are cooking turns
                     black if they are poisonous, and remains white if they are good.”
                     <br> <br>

                    “The saying is a foolish one, and to put it in practice a folly. Silver does not change color any more 
                    from bad than from good mushrooms.”
                    <br> <br>

                    “There is nothing to do, then, but give up mushrooms. That would be hard on me,” said Simon.
                    <br> <br>

                    “No, no; I promise you, on the contrary, that you will be able to use them more than you have done.
                     The only thing is to proceed advisedly.
                     <br> <br>

                    “What is poisonous in mushrooms is not the flesh, but the juice with which it is impregnated. Get rid
                     of that juice, and the injurious properties will disappear immediately. This is accomplished by slicing
                      and cooking the mushrooms, either dried or fresh, in boiling water with a handful of salt. They are then
                       drained in a colander and washed two or three times in cold water. That done, they are prepared in any 
                       way one chooses.
                       <br> <br>

                    “If, on the contrary, mushrooms are prepared without having first been cooked in boiling water, we expose 
                    ourselves to the danger of a poisonous juice.
                    <br> <br>

                    “The cooking in boiling water to which salt has been added is so efficacious that, in order to solve
                     this serious problem, certain persons have had the courage to eat for whole months the most poisonous 
                     mushrooms, prepared, however, in the way I have just told you.”
                     <br> <br>

                    “And what happened to them?” asked Simon.
                </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        “Nothing at all. It is true that these persons prepared their poisonous mushrooms with the most scrupulous care.”
                        <br> <br>

                        “There was reason for it. According to you, then, one could use all mushrooms without distinction?”
                        <br> <br>

                        “Strictly speaking, yes. But that would be going too far, much too far. There would be the 
                        fear of incomplete preparation, insufficient cooking. I only affirm that you must submit 
                        mushrooms of good repute in the neighborhood to the preliminary cooking in boiling water.
                         If, by chance, some poisonous ones were included, the poison would in this way be eliminated
                          and no accident would happen; I would bet my hand on that.”
                          <br> <br>

                        “What you have just taught us, Maître Paul, will be profited by, you may be sure. Are we ever
                         quite certain that there is nothing poisonous in what we gather?”
                         <br> <br>

                        Before saying good-by Simon approached Mother Ambroisine and entered with her into more 
                        circumstantial details of the cooking. He is so fond of mushrooms, the worthy man!        
                
                    </p>
                   

        <h1> CHAPTER LXIV : IN THE WOODS</h1> 

            <p> 
            The history of mushrooms reduced to a rule for cooking which will save us from grave dangers was
             enough for Simon, Mathieu, Jean, and the others, who lacked time to hear more; but Emile, Jules,
              and Claire were not satisfied: they wished to extend their knowledge on these strange vegetables.
               So their uncle took them one day to a beech wood near the village.
               <br> <br>

            The trees, several hundred years old and with their branches meeting at a great height, formed an arch
             of foliage through which, here and there, shone a ray of sunlight. Their smooth trunks, with white bark,
              gave the effect of enormous columns sustaining the weight of an immense building full of shade and silence.
               On the lofty summits crows cawed while smoothing their feathers. Occasionally a redheaded green woodpecker,
                surprised at its work, which consists of pecking the wormy wood with its beak to make the insects come out 
                that it feeds on, gave a cry of alarm and flew off like a dart. In the midst of the moss with which the 
                ground was carpeted were here and there numbers of mushrooms. Some were round, smooth, and white. Jules 
                could not admire them enough; he likened them in his imagination to eggs laid in a mossy hollow by some 
                wandering hen. Others were glossy red, others bright fawn-color, and still others brilliant yellow. Some,
                 just coming out of the ground, were enveloped in a kind of bag that tears open as the mushroom grows; some, 
                 more advanced, spread out like an open umbrella. Finally, there were many that had already begun to decay. 
                 In their fetid rottenness swarmed innumerable grubs, which later would become insects. After picking a number
                  of the principal kinds, the party sat down at the foot of a beech, on the soft moss-carpet, and Uncle Paul spoke thus:
                  <br> <br>

            “A mushroom is the blossom of a plant that lives under ground and is called by learned men mycelium. This subterranean plant is composed of white, slender, fragile threads, resembling in their entirety a large cobweb. If you pull up a mushroom carefully you will see at the base of its stalk, in the earth that clings to it, numerous white threads of the mycelium. Let us imagine a rosebush planted so as to leave nothing but the roses above ground. The buried bush will represent the subterranean mycelium; the roses, open to the air, will represent the blossoms of the mycelium, that is to say the mushrooms.”
            <br> <br>

            “A rosebush,” objected Jules, “has stout branches covered with leaves; the mushroom-plant, according to what I see, has nothing of the sort. It is a kind of moldiness that branches out in the ground in white veins.”
            <br> <br>

            “Those white veins, so delicate that one can hardly touch them without breaking them, form the subterranean plant, without leaves or roots. They lengthen little by little in the ground to a pretty good distance from the point of departure. Then, at a favorable moment, they produce little swellings which grow under ground, become mushrooms, and burst open their bed of earth to expand in the air. This structure explains to us why mushrooms grow in groups. Each group, with the mycelium that produces it, constitutes one and the same plant.”
            <br> <br>

            “I have seen groups of mushrooms in a perfect circle,” Claire remarked.
            <br> <br>

            “If the ground is of uniform character and nowhere hinders the propagation of the subterranean vegetable in one direction rather than in another, the mycelium spreads equally on all sides, and so produces circular groups of mushrooms, which the country people sometimes call witches’ circles.”
            <br> <br>

            “Why witches’ circles?” asked Jules.
            <br> <br>

            “The ignorant and superstitious think they see an effect of witchcraft in this curious circular arrangement, whereas it is but the natural result of the uniformly equal development of the subterranean plant.”
            <br> <br>

            “Then there are no witches?” said Emile.
            <br> <br>

            “No, my dear. There are rogues who abuse the credulity of others; there are simpletons disposed to listen to them; but no one has preternatural powers.”
            <br> <br>

            “Since a mushroom is the blossom of a subterranean plant, of the mycelium, as you call it, must it not have stamens, pistils, ovaries?” Jules inquired.
            <br> <br>

            “A mushroom is in its way the blossom of a kind of vegetable, but its structure has nothing in common with that of ordinary flowers. It is a structure of a special sort, very complicated, very curious, which I shall pass by in silence so as not to overcharge your memory.
            <br> <br>

            “The chief function of a flower, you know, is to produce seeds. Well, the mushroom too produces seeds, but so small, so different from others, that they have a special name,—spores. Spores are the seed of the mushroom, just as acorns are the seed of the oak. That is worthy of some further explanation.
            
        </p>

            </div>
        <p>
            “The mushrooms most familiar to us are composed of a sort of dome supported by a stalk. This dome is called the cap. The under side of the cap takes various shapes, of which the principal are these: Sometimes it is composed of gills which radiate from the center to the border; sometimes it is pierced by an infinity of little holes, which are the orifices of as many tubes joined together in a common mass; sometimes it is covered with fine points like those of a cat’s tongue.
            <br> <br>

            “Mushrooms that have the under side of the cap formed of radiating gills are called agarics; those pierced with little holes, boleti; those covered with little points, hydnei. Agarics and boleti are the most common.”
            <br> <br>

            Here Uncle Paul took, one by one, the mushrooms they had gathered and showed his nephews the gills of the agarics, the holes of the boleti, and the points of the hydnei.
        </p>
            
        
        <h1> CHAPTER LXV :  THE ORANGE-AGARIC  </h1>
             
            <p>
            “Mushroom seeds, or spores, form on these gills, these points, and on the walls of the tubes of which these holes are the orifices. I recommend to Jules the following experiment. We will take some mushrooms whose caps are not yet thoroughly spread. We will place them this evening on a sheet of white paper. During the night the blossoming will be finished and the ripe seeds will fall from the gills of the agarics and the tubes of the boleti. To-morrow morning we shall find on the paper an impalpable dust, red, rose, brown, according to the kind of mushroom.
            <br> <br>
        </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                “This dust is nothing but a mass of seeds, of spores, so fine that they cannot be seen separately without a microscope, so numerous they cannot be counted. There are millions and millions of them.”
                <br> <br>

                “A microscope,” interrupted Emile. “Is that the instrument with which you sometimes look at things so small that the naked eye can scarcely see them?”
                <br> <br>

                “Yes. A microscope enlarges the objects seen through it, and shows them to us in all their details of structure, although they would be hidden from the unaided eye by their smallness.”
                <br> <br>

                “Will you show us through the microscope the mushroom spores when I have collected them on a sheet of paper?” asked Jules.
                <br> <br>

                “I will show them to you. One spore is enough, under favorable conditions of heat and moisture, to germinate and develop into white filaments or mycelium from which will spring at the right time numerous mushrooms. How many mushrooms would be produced if all the spores that fall by myriads and myriads from the gills of a single agaric were to germinate? Here again we have the story of the cod, the louse, all the feeble creatures, in short, that reproduce their kind in such immense numbers.”
                <br> <br>

                “To have mushrooms, then, as many as we want, it is only necessary to sow the spores?” Jules again inquired.

            “In that you are mistaken, my dear child. Up to this time mushroom culture has been impossible, because the care required by their excessively delicate seeds is not understood by us, or may even be beyond our power. Only one edible mushroom is cultivated, and even in growing this we use not the spores, but the mycelium.
            <br> <br>

            “They call it the hot-bed mushroom. It is an agaric, satiny white above and pale rose beneath. In the old stone quarries near Paris they make beds of horse manure and light earth. In these beds they put pieces of mycelium known to horticulturists under the name of mushroom-spawn. This spawn ramifies, pushes out numerous filaments, and from these finally spring the mushrooms.”
            <br> <br>

            “Good to eat!”
            <br> <br>
            
            “Excellent. Among the mushrooms we gathered are those that I am going to acquaint you with.
            <br> <br>
            
            “Look at this first of all. It is an agaric. The upper surface of the cap is a beautiful orange-red; the gills underneath are yellow. The stalk rises from the bottom of a sort of white bag with torn edges. This bag, called volva at first enveloped the whole mushroom. In growing and pushing above ground, the cap broke it. This kind, they say, is the best of all, the most appreciated. It is called the orange-agaric.
            <br> <br>
            
            “This other agaric, likewise orange-red, and also provided with a bag or volva at the base of the stalk, is called the false orange-agaric. Would you not, however, think it was the same kind?”

            “I don’t see much difference, for my part,” responded Claire.
            <br> <br>
            
            “Nor I either,” said Emile.
            <br> <br>
            
            “I see a difference,” Jules declared, “but it is very slight. The second agaric has white gills, while the first has yellow.”
            <br> <br>
            
            “Jules has sharp eyes. I will add that in the false orange-agaric the upper surface of the cap is sown with shreds of white skin, debris of the torn volva. The other one has not these shreds, or very few.
            <br> <br>
            
            “If one did not pay attention to these slight differences, one would commit a very fatal error. The first mushroom is a delicious viand; the second, or false orange-agaric, is a deadly poison.”
            <br> <br>
            
            “I am no longer surprised,” said Jules, “at your telling Simon that it is impossible for us, without long study, to distinguish the good from the bad kinds. Here are two mushrooms almost as much alike as two drops of water: one kills, the other is excellent.”
            <br> <br>
            
            “Not a year passes without its lamentable cases of poisoning, from a confusion of the two kinds. Remember carefully their characteristics, so as not to expose yourself some day to a terrible mistake.”
            <br> <br>
            
            “I will be very careful not to forget them,” Jules promised. “Both orange-agarics are orange-red and have a white volva or bag. The eatable orange-agaric has yellow gills; the poisonous one, white gills.”
            <br> <br>
            
            “Besides,” added Emile, “the poisonous orange-agaric has numerous shreds of white skin on the cap.”
            <br> <br>
            
            “Look at this other that I picked from the trunk of a tree. It is a large, dark-red boletus. It has no stalk. It fastens itself to old trunks by one of its sides. It is called the tinder-agaric boletus, because its flesh, cut in thin slices, dried in the sun, and made flexible by hammering, makes tinder.”
            <br> <br>
            
            “I did not dream that tinder came from a mushroom.” said Jules.
            <br> <br>
            
            “The truffle is the most important of eatable mushrooms. It grows under ground, like the mycelium that produces it. Its odor betrays its presence. A very keen-scented animal, the pig, is led into the wood. Enticed by the smell of the subterranean mushroom, the pig roots with its snout at the spots where the truffles are hidden. Then the pig is driven away, but to console him they throw him a chestnut; and finally the precious mushroom is dug up. In its shape the truffle bears no resemblance to ordinary mushrooms. It has a bulky round body, wrinkled, and black flesh marbled with white.”
